# A variation on A4T Cowl (Sherpa Mounting Pattern) to facilitate the Triangle Labs CHCB-V

## Purpose
Triangle Labs CHCB-V hotend has become increasingly popular for use in the Stealthchanger system given its quality, flow rate and price.  
As people where looking for a high performing toolhead from an cooling perspective, A4T being the best available currently without going to a CPAP system which complicates SC builds, I created a version
that facilitates the additional length (1.87mm) allowing the TL CHCB-V in an A4T Toolhead using the Sherpa Mini Mounting Pattern. It also adjust the mounting holes so you can use the screws that came
with the hotend.


>[!WARNING]
>Does not support Orbitor 2 mounting pattern at this stage however I am happy to create one if people request it.

## What do I need to print and hardware
Only need to print the cowl, the rest is as per standard A4T. CAD and STL Provided
