# Orbiter V2 BTT EBB36 carrier

![orbiter-v2-ebb-carrier](orbiter-v2-ebb-carrier.png)

The stock Dragon Burner PCB carrier with Orbiter V2 and stock extruder mount interferes with the optotap PCB, so I created this  that simply places the EBB36 a few mm higher and also tried to make it as rigid as possible without a lot of extra structures or modifications. 

It uses the standoffs included with the EBB36, wwo M3 BHCS to secure the mount agianst the standoffs, and two M3 SHCS to secure the EBB36 to the mount. 

Print it laying on its back. It is modelled to real-world dimesions but works fine as-is with ABS for me, but you can consider slicing with appropriate shrinkage compensation for your specific filament.
