Since the extuder motor on Orbiter V2 sits quite low, the EBB36 will interfere with the optotap PCB on some toolhead backplates (Dragon Burner and Yavoth, maybe more). So I created this PCB carrier that places the EBB36 a few mm higher than other existing mounts, and also tried to make it as rigid as possible without extra structures or modifications. 

Parts:
* Standoffs included with the EBB36
* 2 M3 BHCS to secure the mount agianst the standoffs
* 2 M3 SHCS to secure the EBB36 to the mount
* Optional: 2 M3 5x4 heat inserts (print the corresponding STL)

It is modelled to real-world dimesions and works fine as-is with ABS for me, but you can consider slicing with appropriate shrinkage compensation for your specific filament for the best possible fit.
