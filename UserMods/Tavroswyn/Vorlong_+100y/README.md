# Modifications for Vorlong +100y with StealthChanger

## Deck Panel 350+100y
[`350_+100y_Deck_Panel.dxf`](Drawing_DXFs/Panels/350_+100y_Deck_Panel.dxf) adds to the original part [`350_Deck_Panel.dxf`](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/Drawing_DXFs/Panels/350_Deck_Panel.dxf) 100mm on the y axis and additional holes for an additional DIN rail.

The original design is described in [`Deck_Panel.PDF`](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/Drawing_DXFs/Panels/Deck_Panel.PDF) and I copied the rounding values from the original dxf files. One could perfectly adapt this manual 1:1 to the Vorlong +100y. However, having an additional 100mm on the y axis adds space for additional DIN rails. This opens up some space for electronics mounting and gives more support for the deck plate. I decided on 3 DIN rails for my design, although 4 would fit too.
