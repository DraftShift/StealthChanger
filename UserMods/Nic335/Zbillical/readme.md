# Z-Umbilical Alternative for Voron 2.4 350mm

We are excited to present the Z-Umbilical Alternative, a superior replacement for the traditional Z-chain on the Voron 2.4 350mm. This innovative solution was developed in collaboration with FizzySG, the brilliant mind behind the EMS system.

## Key Features
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to fit perfectly with the Voron 2.4 350mm, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free installation.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Offers improved stability and reduced wear compared to the conventional Z-chain, resulting in a more reliable and efficient printing experience.
- **Clean Aesthetic:** Provides a sleek and tidy appearance, enhancing the overall look of your 3D printer.
- **Collaborative Design:** Created with input from FizzySG, leveraging the expertise behind the EMS system to deliver a top-notch solution.
- **Flexible Installation:** Can be installed in two ways, with one method allowing for an easier upgrade without the need to change all the wires.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Less prone to wear and tear, leading to fewer maintenance requirements and longer-lasting performance compared to Z-chain wire breakages.
- **Increased Print Quality:** By minimizing vibrations and ensuring consistent motion, it helps achieve higher print quality, especially during fast Z movements for tool changing. This results in smoother transitions and more precise positioning, crucial for multi-tool setups.
- **Ease of Use:** Designed with user-friendliness in mind, making it accessible even for those new to 3D printing modifications.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)
To successfully install the Z-Umbilical, you will need the following components:
- 4 x M3x6 screws
