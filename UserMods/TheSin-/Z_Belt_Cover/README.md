# SC Z Belt Cover

Originally designed by [Akio in the Voron Usermods](https://mods.vorondesign.com/details/LzEFU0RDHXUarF7y69x2Q).

SC Logo added as a cutout, or a raised version.  The raised version needs 2 STLs that you combine in your slicer to allow for 2 colour printing. In Cura this is achieved by adding both to the plate, selecting an extruder per part, then select both then merge.

Combine with [Z Cover Inserts](https://www.printables.com/model/785910-voron-24-z-cover-inserts) to complete the look.
