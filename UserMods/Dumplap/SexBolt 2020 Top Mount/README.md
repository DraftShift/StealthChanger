# SexBolt 2020 Top Mount
Top Mount for the SexBolt Probe that uses hartk1213's Z-Endstop Probe, mounting on top of the 2020 bed extrusions can be helpful for large filter setups or kinematic beds.

## Hardware
2x M3 Heatset's (Voron Spec) <br>
2x M3x20 SHCS <br>
2x M3x6 BHCS        *spacers are used for large filters and require an 8mm screw <br>
2x M3 T-Nut <br>

### Notes
- The stock recommended length for the M5 External Thread Pin is 30mm, however this can be shortened with a top mount to 25mm.
- Be carful when inserting the heatsets as if they are inserted even slightly too far they will prevent your sexbolt from sitting vertical <br>
- The STEP file has the Bushing intersecting the body, dont worry about it, it works...   the 2.25mm spacer is designed to only be the width of the extrusion to allow for 4 nevermore and other carbon filters.
