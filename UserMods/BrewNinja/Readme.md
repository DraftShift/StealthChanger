Anthead Mods
	

 - There is an improved printing version of N3MI's Voron Sherpa spaced Stealthchanger main body. No supports needed.
 - Second version of N3MI's main body with more space above the diffuser/PCB. Read that folder for more info.
 - Thin SC diffuser for resin printing.
 - HGX adapter plate. This fits any of the anthead sherpa spacing bodies. You really don't need this except if you want to run the wires up the back.
