# 5.5 OD Bushing

This is a 5.5 OD bushing. It will not work in the shuttle off of the github. You have to print this one. My carriage is a press fit so you will need calipers to measure the holes and to understand/tune shrink compensation for it to work right. I've also attached an Orca 3mf of how I printed it with the supports painted on.
