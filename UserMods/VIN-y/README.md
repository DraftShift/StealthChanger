# Included mods

## Gantry x/y endstops for Voron (Endstops)

It move the X and Y endstop switches to a single assembly, which attached to the stock Voron A(Y) motor mount.

## Miss Dock

Add compatibility with the MissChanger docking system.

Software:

* This is a very involved mod, as you will need to move to VIN-y's fork of the klipper-toolchanger add-ons, and it is still in alpha.

* If you are a developer, feel free to pick and choose what you want from [VIN-y/klipper-toolchanger (alpha)](https://github.com/VIN-y/klipper-toolchanger/tree/alpha).

Hardware:

* This mod is based on Stealthchanger v1.1. So, make sure to match that version on the shuttle.

* The PDF of the assembly manual for the dock is too large to be included here. you can get it from [MissChanger/STL_Config_Instructions](https://github.com/VIN-y/MissChanger/tree/main/STL_Config_Instructions), specifically in v1.2.
