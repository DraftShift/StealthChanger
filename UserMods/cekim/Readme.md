## Dragon Burner EBB36 mount for the orbit2.0 extruder
This mount for DragonBurner provides a mount for the EBB36 that attaches to the rear of the Orbiter2.0. 

Dragonburner orignal design chirpy2605 here https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron

Traxman25's EBB36 mount takes a different approach and can be found here:

This design attempts to:
- Keep the Orbiter 2.0 on the original/shoter exrtuder block, flush with the top of the cowl.
- Provide a CAN cable stress-relief tower with zip-tie holes that is shifted to be in-line with the filament tube for cable harness alignment.
- Provide clearance for the opto-tap PCB without adding over-all height or extending rearward (the EBB36 and OptoTap will be roughly in-line with eachoter).
- Remove the need for stand-offs and potentially add rigidity by augmenting the attachment screws with design features fit to the outside of the Orbiter2 stepper motor.

This uses "standard" DragaonBurner cowls - though it is specifically fit for Traxman25's numbered cowls for StealthChanger, it will also fit on a standard cowl.  It also works the V1 back-plate for StealthChanger/DragonBurner and OptoTap.

BOM:
- 2 m3 (x4x5) heat-inserts mounted from the opposite side as the EBB36 
- 2 m3x8 BHCS (EBB36 mount)
- (recommended) 2 m3x18 SHCS to replace the orbiter's stock screws and provide more thread purchase in the ABS.

Printing:
I print this standing upright as it sits in the machine with organic/tree supports painted on to the most obvious overhangs.  I use ABS with no adjustmnet for shrinkage from the design files as provided.

Installation:
- Install heatsets to side opposite the EBB36 mounting face.  Ensure they are straight and the screw-path clear of overmelt after installation
- Remove the 2 m3x16 SHCS holding the stepper motor of the Orbiter2.0 to the gearbox taking care to keep the gearbox assembled while the screws are removed.
- Ideally, replace those with m3x18 screws, though the m3x16 will generally provide some grab (it is threaded into ABS, so mileage may vary on strength).
- While keeping the stepper motor and gearbox assembly together, slide the rear of the stepper into the mount's cup that is sized to fit around it.
- Line up the screw-holes on the fingers with the Orbiter's stepper motor fastener holes.
- While pressing this entire assembly together, thread in the m3x18 (or original m3x16) screws.  You are simultaneously fastening the Orbiter2.0 stepper to its gear-box and self-tapping the 3mm ABS holes on the mounting bracket, so keep them pressed together the entire time.
- Install EBB36 with 2 m3x8 BHCS to the rear.
- Wire as needed.
