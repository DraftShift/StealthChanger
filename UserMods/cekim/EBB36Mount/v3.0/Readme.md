## Dragon Burner EBB36 mount for the Orbiter2.x extruder
This mount for DragonBurner provides a mount for the EBB36 that attaches to the rear of the Orbiter2.x and provides a pivoting strain-relief tower intended to be used with a 1mm piano wire.

## Design Goals:
- As with prior versions, provided centered EBB36 mount (offset from extruder motor) and provide clearance for optTap sensor
- Move cable mount to pivoting tower as close to the front as possible to line up with the filament tube
- Optional heatset in the wire strain-relief tower to permit bung-screw to clamp the piano wire
- Does not integrate with the filament sensor, optimizing for umbilical/PTFE alignment/movement

## BOM:
- 3x m3 (x4x5) heatset-inserts in EBB36 mount holes 
- 2 m3x8 SHCS or BHCS (EBB36 mount)
- 1 m3x20 SHCS (pivot mount)
- (optional) 1x m3x4x5 heatset-insert for wire-tower clamp
- (optional) 1x m3x4 cup-point set-screw (bung screw)

## Printing:
- I print this standing upright with supports on overhanging elements
- ABS with shrinkage compensation - ensure you are printing with accurate dimensionality of finished part

## Installation:
- Install heatsets to EBB36 mounting face.
- Remove the 2 m3x16 SHCS holding the stepper motor of the Orbiter2.0 to the gearbox taking care to keep the gearbox assembled while the screws are removed.
- Replace stock gear-box screws with m3x25 screws
- While keeping the stepper motor, optional sensor and gearbox assembly together, slide the rear of the stepper into the mount's cup that is sized to fit around it. 
- Line up the screw-holes on the fingers with the Orbiter's stepper motor fastener holes.
- While pressing this entire assembly together, thread in the m3x25 screws.  You are simultaneously fastening the Orbiter2.x stepper to its gear-box and self-tapping the 3mm ABS holes on the mounting bracket, so keep them pressed together the entire time.
- Install EBB36 with 2 m3x8 SHCS or BHCS to the rear.
- If using the "piano-wire" hole, you may want to insert your 1mm wire prior to assembly to clear out any printing artifacts.  It is a ~18-20mm deep hole.
- If using the clamping wire-tower, press the heat-set insert into the tower
- Fasten the piano wire with teh m3x4 bung/set screw
- Wire as needed.
