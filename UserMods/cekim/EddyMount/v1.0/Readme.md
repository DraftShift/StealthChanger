## Eddy Coil Mount in a DragonBurner Tool-head
This design places the EddyCoil PCB in the spacer of the Dragon Burner toolhead

Dragonburner orignal design chirpy2605 here https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron

## Design Goals:
- Integrate EddyCoil into dockable toolhead

This uses "standard" DragaonBurner cowls

## BOM:
- (optional) aluminum tape (insullation)
- (optional) catridge PT1000 sensor

## Printing:
- Print in normal orientation for spacer
- Use supports for inner segments of both the spacer and front cover

## Installation:
- Insert PT1000
- Remove Eddy from its housing (carefully)
- Insert Eddy into printed spacer
- Place front cover
- Install spacer as normal from here
