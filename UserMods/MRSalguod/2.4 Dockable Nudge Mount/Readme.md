### Information:

This is a mod of [VIN-y's Removable 2.4 Mount](https://github.com/zruncho3d/nudge/tree/main/User%20Mods/VIN-y/Removable%202.4%20Mount) for the [Nudge probe](https://github.com/zruncho3d/nudge/tree/main). 

It is dockable so that you don't loose any build volume. It also has a microswitch so that when it is docked is always triggered. 

### My Modifications:
