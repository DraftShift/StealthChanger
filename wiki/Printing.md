## Parts

**NOTE: If you plan on using the Tapchanger Dragonburner dock you must use the [custom cowl by OstroMa](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/blob/main/UserMods/OstroMa/DB_Cowl_v8_with_TapChanger_Dock_Hooks.stl). We always recommend to use the original cowls when possible and the [Modular Dock](https://github.com/DraftShift/ModularDock) does not require any special Cowl, print the original from the Dragonburner repo.**


Coming Soon


## Settings

All print settings are the same as [Voron Standards](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings) or better.

Since every filament shrinks at a different rate and our tolerances are too tight to allow for "pre-scalling".  You need to calibrate the shrinkage for each and every filament you use, even the same brand but different colour can shrink at a different rate.  We recommend using Califlower for each filament.

- Shuttle is the only part that requires supports and should be set to `touching build plate`

## Orientation

Print orientation is flat on the parts back with supports enabled currently, we are working on models with integrated supports.

- All stls are in the proper print orientation
