## Parts

**NOTE: The Dragonburner dock in the Tapchanger repo uses a custom cowl that is not compatible with or supported by Stealthchanger. Until a dock that is compatible with the original Dragonburner cowl is released, you must use the [custom cowl by OstroMa](https://github.com/Hellsparks/StealthChanger/blob/main/UserMods/OstroMa/DB_Cowl_v8_with_TapChanger_Dock_Hooks.stl). We always recommend to use the original cowls when possible.**


Coming Soon

## Orientation

Print orientation is flat on the parts back with supports enabled currently, we are working on models with integrated supports.
