The team has created their own dock as a solution. It allows for mounting from both the top bar, as well as a crossbar (or both). While its currently still in testing, its an option if you can do some work without having a full readme. You can view it here: [StealthChanger Modular Dock](https://github.com/Stealthchanger/ModularDock)

Currently all docks used with [Viesturz's Tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger) are compatible.
