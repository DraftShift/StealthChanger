## Shuttle

- [3] 6x3mm magnets (N52 Highly recommended to counter the pull from the umbilicals)
- [2] m3x6 BHCS (tap sensor)
- [4] m3x6 BHCS head (mgn bolts) `m3x12 if used with the shuttle keeper`

### All Tools

**Note:** heatsets on the SB version in from the opposite side as the Voron instructions, slightly longer screws on the CW2 attachment may be required

- [4] m3 heat inserts
- [3] Ø4x12mm ssRod (dowel pin) with a rounded end **(if it has female threads on the back it will be listed as an M3, but make sure the pin is 4mm OD, that is what is important. We recommend the threaded pins for better fixing)**
- [1] 6x3mm magnet (N52 Highly recommended to counter the pull from the umbilicals. Note that most magnets not from a reputable source may say N52 but aren't actually. Recommend one of the two links below.)
- [2] m3x6 or m3x8 FHCS (Flat head countersunk screw, MUST BE MAGNETIC. no stainless, as per TAP)
- [1] [OptoTap](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEGsGTV) (only the sensor PCB is required)
- [1] m3x8 BHCS (optional in v1.1)


**The list bellow is in addition to the Stealthburner BOM above.**


### Dragonburner/Rapidburner/Yavoth

- [2] m3x8 BHCS (optional in v1.1)

**Note:** Dragonburner [extended mount](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/general/Alternative_Voron_Mounts/Extended_Extruder_Mounts) is required depending on extruder


### Archetype Blackbird

- [1] m3x12 BHCS (to hold the sherpa mount in place)
- [2] m3 heat inserts
- [2] m3x8 BHCS (optional in v1.1)

### Xol

- [2] m3x6 BHCS (backplate lower mounting screws. m3x8 will be too long)
- [2] m3x20 BHCS (backplate upper mounting screws)
- [2] m3x8 BHCS (extruder mount to backplate)
- [2] m3x6 FHCS **magnetic** (preload screws. m3x8 will be too long)
- You will **not be able** to use stock 2.4 Z joints with Xol or A4T.
- Replacement of your Z joints with something with a lower profile such as [hartk123's GE5C Z Joint](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_GE5C) or [Ellis'Short Z Joints](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/Ellis/Short_Z_Joints) is necessary to avoid bottoming out your Z carriage on the deck panel when using Xol or A4T.

### A4T

- [2] m3x12 BHCS / SHCS (backplate upper mounting screws)

## Options

You will likely need help with belts, make sure to decide on if you will use the [shuttle keeper](https://github.com/DraftShift/Stealthchanger/tree/main/STLs/Extras) or use the [belt helper](https://github.com/DraftShift/Stealthchanger/tree/main/STLs/Extras/BeltHelper).  And print the required parts and make sure to have the addition bill of materials for them.

**NOTE:** Only use the hartk style bodys with the sleeves, knockoffs have too much slop.
