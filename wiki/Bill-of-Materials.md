You will likely need help with belts, make sure to decide on if you will use the [shuttle keeper](https://github.com/DraftShift/Stealthchanger/tree/main/STLs/Extras) or use the [belt helper](https://github.com/DraftShift/Stealthchanger/tree/main/STLs/Extras/BeltHelper).  And print the required parts and make sure to have the addition bill of materials for them.
