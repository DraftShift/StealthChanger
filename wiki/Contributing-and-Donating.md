**STEP 1 for all options**

Follow [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)


## Design Changes

- Make sure to be detailed about all changes in the Description
- Make sure to include updated CAD files and all changed STLs
- Make sure to indicate any manual changes required (including image updates in the manual)


## Wiki/Docu

- Make sure the pull request only contains changes to the `wiki` folder and is in proper [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- Make sure to include a good description


## UserMods

- Make sure the directory in UserMods is your github username
- Make sure the mod is in it's own folder, do not put everything in the root of your UserMod folder
- Make sure to include a clear `README.md` per mod, you made have a general one as well but each mod requires it's own.
- Make sure the `README.md` contains all credits with links **respect and follow GPL**
- Make sure to be descriptive in your pull request
- Sign up for [file watcher](https://app.github-file-watcher.com/), it's your responsibility to monitor changes and keep your UserMod up to date and usable, broken or orphanded mods will be removed
- Make sure to be in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/jJs73c6vSc) to be able to support your mod, no support is the same as not updating


**Not following any of these guide lines will result in the pull request being denied**
