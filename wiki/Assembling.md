**NOTE: Currently pins may feel very loose, this is by design to allow for room for glue or epoxy (recommended) to set.  Normally press fit is good enough for testined, but for actual use make sure to secure the pins properly.**

**NOTE: D2HW shuttle is not compatible with Hall Effects, and D2HW back plate will affect cooling.**

## Assembling Shuttle and Backplates

In order to get proper matching set you should:
- insert pins in your best backplate (straightest)
- press bushings in the shuttle and ensure a smooth mating between the parts.
- if everything feels smooth, pop the bushings out and glue them in place using either superglue or epoxy, other wise see [Heat Treating](#heat-treating)
- be sure to test that the mating still feels smooth after the glue sets.
- You can now use the shuttle as a "master blank" for glueing the pins into all your backplates.


## Preload

**NOTE** Every backplate needs to be adjusted.

Preload is meant remove all the wiggle when it's fully seated by preloading the pins onto the bushings.

To set your preload you want to back the FSCS screws till they are just touching the magnest on the shuttle.  See [Preload Paper Trick](#preload-paper-trick)


## Tips and Tricks

### Heat Treating

If you printed the shuttle and backplate and things are just not smooth or you have slight binding, you can Heat Treat it and here is how.
- Fully assemble the shuttle and backplate with Bushing, Pins, Screws and Magnets
- Set your heat bed to 100-110°C
- Once at temperature, mate both parts fully, and set them on the bed with the backplate (tool side) down
- After 20+ minutes pick them up and slide them 3-4 times, then fully mate them once again
- With both parts still fully mated, set them down with the backplate (tool side) down someplace flat and at room temperature and let them fully cool without touching them for 5+ hours
- Try and slide them again and you should feel an improvement, you can try this multiple times if you are still not satisfied

### Preload Paper Trick

You can use a piece of paper per side to make sure they both have the same pressure.

### Cleaning out bushings

Sometimes the bushings aren't debured or do not slide well when you recieve them.

[![Bushing Cleaning](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AHlydBsMJro/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHlydBsMJro)

- Find a drill bit 4mm or smaller (I’m using 3mm in the video at the link)
- Using your thumb, apply pressure onto the bush and roll back and forth on the drill bit. 
- Test on the pin again
- Rinse and repeat. 

Some bushings take multiple tries, but try not to over do it, just enough that the bushing falls on the pin.
